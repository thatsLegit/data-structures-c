//Here is just a reminder of some definitions are rules common to trees.

//*Tree: root, Nodes, Siblings, branches (Edge) and Leafs (dead-ends)
//Branching factor: number of branches at the base of each node.
//Each branch line in a tree is basically like a SLL

//Rules: each node is a child of its parent node.
//Each child must have one a only one parent.
//Childs within the same node cannot be connected.

//? A tree is a particular case of graph: it's undirected, 
//? unweighted and there's always only one path to get to any node/vertex.
